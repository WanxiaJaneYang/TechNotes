# Simplifying Error Handling in React with Axios

## Introduction
In my recent projects, I've been extensively using React in conjunction with Axios for API interactions. I noticed a pattern in how I was handling errors - it was repetitive and not as efficient as it could be. This blog post will discuss how I identified the issue and streamlined my error handling approach using Axios instances.

## The Challenge: Repetitive Error Handling
Initially, my error handling approach involved giving specific error messages to the front-end user based on different HTTP status codes. For instance:
- Code 404: Suggested a network problem or the target was not found.
- Code 500: Indicated an unknown server error and advised contacting support.
- Code 401: Informed about access issues.

Here is an example of how I was handling these errors:

```javascript
axios.get('some-api-endpoint')
  .then(response => {
    // Handle successful response
  })
  .catch(error => {
    if (error.response.status === 404) {
      // Handle 404 error
    } else if (error.response.status === 500) {
      // Handle 500 error
    } // ... and so on
  });
